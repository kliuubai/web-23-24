    <h2 style="text-align: center;">A little about the history and mechanics of the theremin.</h2>

    <p id="about-desc">The theremin is an electronic instrument that a musician plays <span id="about-span">without ever touching it</span>. The player's hands manipulate the electromagnetic fields around the antennas, producing different pitches and volumes, all without coming into physical contact with the instrument. Leon Theremin, a Russian scientist, invented the instrument in 1920 (he also worked in espionage). Eventually, Clara Rockmore, a renowned prodigy on the violin, became the theremin's most renowned performer. Born in Lithuania, she mastered the instrument's delicate control, which was difficult to finesse because of how sensitive the antennas were (making it very difficult to hold a consistent, steady note). Rockmoreâ€™s collaboration with Theremin led to the development of the instrument's playing technique. Together, they showcased the theremin's potential in both classical and contemporary music, and the potential of electronic music and instruments as a whole. While Theremin pioneered the instrument's creation, Clara Rockmore's artistry and dedication played a crucial role in establishing the theremin as a legitimate instrument. The theremin's appeal lies in its ability to generate sliding, vibrating tones, creating a sci-fi and kind of creepy sound which lent to its ability to be used in 20th century film music. I made a website about the theremin because I think it sounds pretty cool (a little eerie) and because I thought the story of its inventors and usages was interesting.</p>
